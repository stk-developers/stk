!!! InputXform -> XformInstance ???
!!! Check that numer of states in the two models match
+ NaN appears in models for zero occupation probamilities
!!! Wierd meaning of macro->occurances for training from network
+ Times in output labels overflow for long utterances

+ All SXStats features buld in SERest
+ Joint Single Pass Training and Two Model Re-estimation
+ Computation of derivatives - stacking
+ Segmentation in feature list
+ Output statistics
+ Recognition from networks (latices)
+ Network holds information about timing
+ Save(/Read) xform statistics in binary
+ Save/Read HMMs binary
+ Copy Xform
+ Use better hash that is extendable
+ MMI training
+ Software to pack mutiple accumulator files into single file
- Re-estimation of models with more last level xforms
- Load HMMs from individual files
- Mixture pruning threshold
- Advanced variance flooring (fraction of global/state (with-in class) variance, Xform specific varFloors)
- To do something with error messages (at line in file-> (filename:line),...)
- Sort Gaussians according to their weights
+ SREsults for KWS
- SREsults should inform about ignored labels (not present in label list)
- <Stream>
- Memory for mean and variance accumulators is always alocated to double size for MMI or MPE stats (even with ML training)
- Accumulator files always contain weight_accum_den (not very elegant)
- Something should be done with
- In MPE update weight_accum_den is passed using quite ugly hack that work only if mixtures are not shared by more states
- _Z online computation
- Discarding mixture components with low occupancy

Documentation
- MLF is red sequentionally -> Sort labels file records
- ALLOWXWRDEXP switch triphone expansion on, other expansion parameters are ignored
- Module names in config are ignored except PARAM1 and PARAM2, tool name can be used for any parameter

Following wrong use of ExpandNet (mlf used insted if dictionary) result in segmentation fault
~/STK/ExpandNet -m -e -f lab -I ctstrain04.v0.sil.mlf -y net ctstrain04.v0.sil.mlf che-04571-A_4571Af-che_046968_049030.lab

Bugs:
Wrong total likelihood is reported with Viterbi trainind
One word insertion penalty is not added to the total score
Unreachable nodes must be removed before sorting in LatticeLocalOptimization()
varFloor1 works only without Xforms. Xform specific varFloors are needed
RemoveRedundantNullNodes can cause doubled links, which leads to error
Global Xform defined after HMMs cause error
DC phone expansion of network with short circuit leads to infinite loop
<Copy> accept range (from:to) larger than its output size
HPARM{1,2} in not recognized (only SPARM{1,2})

To finish new SKT networks
- Expanded network cannot hold information about word output symbols and
  pronunciation probabilities (HTK place -r to arc definition)
- Phone accuracy
- For SVite and HERest model nodes must be of NT_Model (not NT_Phone) and must beconnected to corresponding HMM structures
- MakeNetworkFromLabels does not treat correctly mutli-level labels

Config parameter remapings:
SOURCELABEL -> SOURCETRANSCFMT
TARGETLABEL -> TARGETTRANSCFMT
PARAM1 -> ALIGN
PARAM2 -> ''
MODELMMF -> MMF
