!!! InputXform -> XformInstance ???
!!! Check that numer of states in the two models match
+ NaN appears in models for zero occupation probamilities
!!! Wierd meaning of macro->occurances for training from network
+ Times in output labels overflow for long utterances

+ All SXStats features buld in SERest
+ Joint Single Pass Training and Two Model Re-estimation
+ Computation of derivatives - stacking
+ Segmentation in feature list
+ Output statistics
+ Recognition from networks (latices)
+ Network holds information about timing
+ Save(/Read) xform statistics in binary
+ Save/Read HMMs binary
+ Copy Xform
+ Use better hash that is extendable
+ MMI training
+ Software to pack mutiple accumulator files into single file
- Re-estimation of models with more last level xforms
+ Load HMMs from individual files
- Mixture pruning threshold
- Advanced variance flooring (fraction of global/state (with-in class) variance, Xform specific varFloors)
- To do something with error messages (at line in file-> (filename:line),...)
- Sort Gaussians according to their weights
+ SREsults for KWS
- SREsults should inform about ignored labels (not present in label list)
- <Stream>
- Memory for mean and variance accumulators is always alocated to double size for MMI or MPE stats (even with ML training)
- Accumulator files always contain weight_accum_den (not very elegant)
- In MPE update weight_accum_den is passed using quite ugly hack that work only if mixtures are not shared by more states
+ _Z online computation
+ Discarding mixture components with low occupancy

+ Speaker dependent MMF replacing some of macro definitions is now possible. Hoewer, ...
  - Redefinition of logical model in tiedlist is ignored
  - Newly loaded HMM's are not relinked in network -> Redefinition of HMM will cause program to crash.
  - When redefining Xforms, the new Xform should be checked for compatibility with the old one (mem. size, delay, etc.)
  
Documentation
- MLF is red sequentionally -> Sort labels file records
- ALLOWXWRDEXP switch triphone expansion on, other expansion parameters are ignored
- Module names in config are ignored except PARAM1 and PARAM2, tool name can be used for any parameter

Following wrong use of ExpandNet (mlf used insted if dictionary) result in segmentation fault
~/STK/ExpandNet -m -e -f lab -I ctstrain04.v0.sil.mlf -y net ctstrain04.v0.sil.mlf che-04571-A_4571Af-che_046968_049030.lab

Bugs:
Wrong total likelihood is reported with Viterbi trainind
One word insertion penalty is not added to the total score
Unreachable nodes must be removed before sorting in LatticeLocalOptimization()
+ varFloor1 works only without Xforms. Xform specific varFloors are needed
+ RemoveRedundantNullNodes can cause doubled links, which leads to error
Global Xform defined after HMMs cause error
CD phone expansion of network with short circuit leads to infinite loop
<Copy> accept range (from:to) larger than its output size
HPARM{1,2} in not recognized (only SPARM{1,2})
SVite: -w (without para does not switch on -G STH)
In common.C: fstat(fileno(fp), &sb) does not work with 64bit architecture
SERest.c tries to update varFloorXFORMNAME macros, which results in vector on NaNs and screw up the flooring
Extension after -z option is ignored, -y is used instead. But is not it actually better?
To solve how to control and perform input/output network optimizations.
Currently Multiple-CMLLR cannot be performed as we do not take into account determinants of different xforms in likelihood computation
For example, DiagCGaussianDensity is now method of decoder. But this function may be usefull also out of decoder context.
Local optimization before posterior pruning makes statr_beta and end_alpha quite different - probably thanks to weight-pushing.
Size of accumulators depends on update type -> update type should be specified (and fixed) before HmmSet::Init 
                                               or we should report error if accums are not allocated properly (may be this isbetter option)
For empty input network file, SExpan announce: ReadSTKNetwork: Network has multiple nodes with no successors 
Estimation of tied variance vectors is completely wrong: single (tied) mean is considered for all tied variance vectors.

To finish new SKT networks
- Expanded network cannot hold information about word output symbols and
  pronunciation probabilities (HTK place -r to arc definition)
- Phone accuracy: sil and sp is still hardwired as silence models
+ For SVite and HERest model nodes must be of NT_Model (not NT_Phone) and must beconnected to corresponding HMM structures
- MakeNetworkFromLabels does not treat correctly mutli-level labels

Config parameter remapings:
SOURCELABEL -> SOURCETRANSCFMT
TARGETLABEL -> TARGETTRANSCFMT
PARAM1 -> ALIGN
PARAM2 -> ''
MODELMMF -> MMF

Ideas for MPE:
  num-den + Tau -> num-den + Tau*num-den/num+den)
  E * den -> E * num+den
  minocc based on num+den for MPE or num for MMI



ToDo(extra):
- Expansion and optimization - add scaling params
- Descale scores in lattices after their generation
- Get rid of labels (replace by lattices)
- Make the networks transparent and simple
- use DEFINE on template network... 
- separate decoder from network a bit more...
- fix FeatureRepository
